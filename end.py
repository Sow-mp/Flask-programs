#Flask is a micro web framework in Python.
#"Micro" means it is lightweight and simple,
# but still very powerful.
#It lets you build web applications
# (websites, APIs, dashboards, etc.) quickly.
#Building Web Applications
#Create websites with routes (/home, /about, etc.).
#Render HTML pages with templates (Jinja2).
#Building REST APIs
#Easily create backend services to send/receive JSON data.
#Example: Flask is often used for machine learning model APIs.
#Prototyping / Learning
#Because itâ€™s simple and flexible,
# Flask is great for beginners and for quickly testing ideas.
#Integration

#Works well with databases (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

#Supports user authentication, forms, file uploads, etc.
